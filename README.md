Aetherum: The Shattered Realms is an immersive card game that transports players to a mysterious world fractured by an ancient catastrophe. In this game, players take on the roles of Conduits—powerful individuals who draw upon the unique energies of fragmented realms, known as Shards. Each Shard offers its own arcane power, hidden secrets, and untamed forces, but the path to power is not without peril.

Through careful strategy, resource management, and the wielding of eldritch artifacts, players must navigate a world of complex alliances, ancient relics, and cosmic forces. The choices players make shape their Conduit’s path, from alliances with forbidden entities to quests for hidden knowledge that may unravel—or restore—the fractured realms of Aetherum.

Current Status:
This project is a work in progress, and all aspects of gameplay, lore, and mechanics are subject to change as development continues. Expect refinements, new features, and additional content as I continue to build out the world of Aetherum.
